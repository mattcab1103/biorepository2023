      <p>The pin you clicked on is a picture of a lace coral, located in the Indian ocean, a part of the phylum Cnidaria, the second basal taxa after Porifera. </p><br>

      <p>Cnidaria's name comes from the Greek word, cnidos, which means "nettle", a kind of stinging plant. In fact, Cnidaria is characterized by their stinging tentacles, with various important organelles that help them capture prey, called <strong>nematocysts.</strong> Examples of organisms in this phylum are corals and jellyfish.
      </p><br>

      <img class="centermod" src="../assets/images2/hydracnido.png"><br>

      <p>Other than that, Cnidaria is also characterized for its radially similar bodies, categorized into two distinct shapes called <strong>medusa and polyp</strong>. In both, a tentacle-ringed mouth serves as the facilitator for digestion and gas exchange. </p><br>

      <img class="centermod" src="../assets/images2/polypmedusa.png"><br>

      <p>In conception, they only form two germ layers, the ectoderm and the mesoderm, which give rise to the epidermis and the gastrodermis. In the epidermis, there are structures called <strong>rhopalia</strong> that can generate signals in response to stimuli. In order to connect those sensory stimuli, a simple nervous system or <strong>nerve net</strong> is in place, though this can be used to move contractile cells.  Such contractions redistribute the phylum's water-filled insides and create a <strong>hydrostatic skeleton</strong>, their own support system.</p>

      <p>The pin you clicked on is an example of a recently discovered new species that appeared in metropolitan France, <em>Humbertium covidum</em>, an organism in the phylum Plathyhelminthes.  </p><br>

      <p>The phylum name comes from Greek: platy-means flat, and helminth means worm. This phylum is characterized by the flattened form of the worm, but also evolution-wise, the emergence of three-layered embryo and organ systems. 
      </p><br>

      <p>Flatworms are bilateral and cephalized. They have genes that resemble coeloms, despite not having a coelom at all.</p><br>

      <img class="centermod" src="../assets/images2/planarian.png"><br>

      <p>Turbellarians, flukes, and tapeworms are the three main groups. Most tubellarians live in the sea, but some live in fresh water, and a few live in moist places on land. They are often found as parasites on animals, such as flukes and tapeworms.</p><br>

      <p>Turbellians have a mouth and a gut, however tapeworms do not have either of these, due to their parasitic nature; as they had a habitat rich in resources and predigested food, those traits were ruled out in the long run.</p><br>

      <h3>Impact and Importance</h3>

      <p>The flatworm you saw in the picture was only discovered recently, but it is already being studied for the possibility of it ruining biodiversity in Europe, as it may be an invasive species in the future.</p><br>

      <p>Parasites also pose a very huge problem health wise. If humans ingest parasitic eggs and tapeworms grow in their bodies, it would be dangerous and even lethal. In under-developed countries, where medication is not readily available, this would be disastrous.</p><br>

        Nematodes are bilateral, unsegmented worms with a cuticle-covered sylindrical body. It is also characterized by a muscular pharynx which sucks up food and with the digestive system being complete, making up the pseudocoelom. 
      </p><br>

      <p>

        Roundworms have collagen-rich, pliable cuticles that is repeatedly molted as the animal grows. </p><br>

        <h3>Impact and Importance</h3>

        <p>Some roundworms are parasitic, and impair human health. Eating undercooked pork can lead to an infection by <em>Trichinella spiralis</em>, which if not treated properly, could be fatal. It moves from the digestive system, through the blood and in the muscles where it forms cysts.</p><br>

        <p>A creepy fact: some parasites are just dormant in the body. People with <em>Ascaris lumbricoides</em> for example often show no symptoms. It is unknown how many people world wide are infected by the Ascaris group, but currently, 1 billion people, primarily in Asia and Latin America, have it.</p>

      <img class="center" style="display: inline-block;" src="../assets/images2/arthr.png"><img class="center" style="display: inline-block;" src="../assets/images2/kingcrab.jpg"><br><br>

      <p>Arthropods are bilateral organisms that have a reduced coelom. They have a hard exoskeleton with complete organ systems. Modern subgroups of arthropods include crustaceans and insects, which include a lot of organisms. If you were to measure evolutionary success by how many species form in one clade, then arthropods would be the most successful.</p><br>
      <p> There are overall 5 key adaptations that let to their evolutionary success. </p><br>
      <h4>Key Arthropod Adaptations</h4><br>
      <p><strong>Hardened Exoskeleton</strong> – Arthropods have a skin made of chitin, proteins and waxes. This is called an exoskeleton, and has many functions, including helping to fend predators and helping to support their weight. Though exoskeletons may be hard, they molt and thus facilitate growth in arthropods. </p><br>
      <p><strong>Jointed Appendages</strong> – Exoskeletons are hard, and if they were rigid, all arthropods wouldn’t be able to move correctly. Thus, arthropods evolved to include only thin exoskeleton-like parts on the joints so they could be able to move. Arthropods themselves means “jointed leg”, and these jointed legs are then modified for specialized tasks. </p><br>
      <p><strong>Highly Modified Segments</strong> – Early forms of the clade had distinct body segments and similar body appendages, which were not specialized and modified for special use. Now, most modern arthropods fused their parts into different structural units, such as the thorax and the abdomen. Another feature is that their segments were also modified for special use, such as in insects, where thin extensions of the wall of some segments became their wings. </p><br>
      <p><strong>Specializations</strong>  – Arthropods have sensory organs that are built well, such as one or more pairs of eyes, and antennae that can detect touch and certain chemicals. </p><br>
      <p><strong>Specialized Developmental Stages</strong> – As children turn into adults, a process called metamorphosis where the organism is remodeled, happens. Each stage of metamorphosis is built for a different task, and this also helps them prevent competition with each other for the same niche. </p><br>

      <h3>Impact and Importance</h3>
        <p>Most arthropods are used as food sources. Lobsters and crabs can be used as a food source, directly eaten. Some arthropods do it in a roundabout way. Bees are a great example of indirect sourcing. Bees can produce honey for us humans to eat as a food source. </p><br>
        <p>The king crab in the picture is a good source of food, however it is a prevailing invasive species in Norwegian waters. There is a rush now to collect king crabs as delicacies but also to protect the ecosystem. </p><br>
        <p>Insects can also act as decomposers. Cockroaches, millipedes and other “filthy” organisms can be used to get rid of food waste, and can be used to create fertilizers and compost, among other things. </p><br>

    <h2>Amphibians</h2>
    <a class="close" href="#">&times;</a>
    <div class="content">

      <img class="center" style="display: inline-block;" src="images/chordates/chrodata.png"><img class="center" style="display: inline-block;" src="images/chordates/axo.jpg"><br><br>

      <p> Amphibians are land-dwelling vertebrates that breed in water and have a three-chambered heart. They evolved from the Devonian Age, where there was a lot of “distinct” fishes in the sea, due to adaptive radiation, a phenomenon in which multiple organisms try to conquer new available niches. </p><br>
      <p>Some of these organisms found land to be a good alternative to finding food and reducing competition, and so they developed to be tetra pods, four-legged walkers, coming from a fish’s pelvic and pectoral finds. Needless to say, they are homologous to amphibian limb bones. In addition to the tetra pods, the transition to land was aided by the development of the three-chambered heart. The three-chambered heart allowed for blood to flow in two circuits, one to the body and one to the lungs. Their senses were also improved as a result, in order to adjust to dry land. </p><br>
      <p>Modern-day amphibians also breed in water and go through metamorphosis, changing from their gills to their lungs in adulthood.</p><br>
      <p>In total, there are three broad categories to modern amphibians: salamanders, caecilians and frogs. </p><br>

      <h4>Amphibian Groups</h4><br>

      <p><strong>Salamanders</strong> – The closest ancestors to modern amphibians probably looked a lot like modern day salamanders. The forelimbs and back limbs are similar and there would be a long tail as well. Adding to that fact, their body moves from side to side, quite like a fish would out of water. </p><br>
      <p><strong>Caecilians</strong> – One could say that the closest relatives of salamanders are caecilians. They are quite different from the other amphibians. They are tetra pods…without legs. This is due to their adapting with the burrowing way of life. Many caecilians burrow blind and use their sense of touch to eat prey. Following this logic, they are blind as well, leaving their eyes to strengthen other senses. </p><br>
      <p><strong>Frogs</strong> - Frogs belong to the most diverse amphibian group. Frogs have developed strong hind legs to propel them upwards to high heights. Their fore legs help them cushion the blow and supports their body. </p><br>

      <img class="centermod" src="images/chordates/amphi.png">

      <h3>Impact and Importance</h3>
        <p>Amphibians can act as prey and predator, and thus support the food cycle, powering the biosphere of the world. Frogs in particular can be important, for example in eating pests, thus benefiting in agriculture. </p><br>

        <p>The health of ecosystems can also be determined with amphibians, due to the vulnerability of amphibians regarding toxic substances</p>

      <img class="center" style="display: inline-block;" src="images/chordates/chrodata.png"><img class="center" style="display: inline-block;" src="images/chordates/cro.jpg"><br><br>

      <p> Reptiles come from the Latin word for creep, “repto,” which makes sense as some do creep about, but they also do…other things.   </p><br>
      <p>Reptiles are best known for their scales, developing from the epidermis of their skin layer. They also have cloaca, a kind of opening that expels digestive and urinary waste, as well as provide an insert for reproductive actions. Reptiles, unlike amphibians and fishes, developed an ability that allows for their offspring to grow on land, which are basically, eggs. These came from the amniotes, stem reptiles that made eggs with four membranes, to develop further away from water. These stem reptiles gave rise to the dinosaurs of the old age, and the lizards and snakes we know now.  </p><br>
      <p>These reptiles are ectotherms, with their body temperature dependent on the temperature of their surroundings. Examples of this being acted upon are reptiles in temperate seasons burrowing on land, or with turtles that settle in mud. </p><br>
      <p>There are five groups that are important to reptiles: Turtles, Lizards, Tuataras, Snakes and Crocodilians. </p><br>

      <h4>Reptilian Groups</h4><br>

      <p><strong>Turtles</strong> – Turtles are known for their unique shell, which is made of a bony, scale-covered shell. Their vertebrae are on the shell, and the shell acts as a rib-cage for them. Turtles do not have teeth, but rather a beak made of keratin. Due to their nature of laying eggs on beaches, along with increasing human presence, threatens their species. Many turtle species are endangered. </p><br>
      <p><strong>Lizards</strong>	– The lizards are the most diverse species, consisting of species as small as a coin and as big as 3 meters in length, like Komodo dragons. Lizards have defenses to avoid becoming prey, some of which includes trying to outrun predators or startling them. Some even detach their tail to distract the predator while they flee.  </p><br>
      <p><strong>Tuataras</strong> – Most tuataras live in New Zealand but they were once a dominating species on Earth. Tuatara means “peaks on the back” in the language of the Maori people, the native people in New Zealand. Tuataras are the closest-relative of amphibians to reptiles, and one can see this through the way the species walks. </p><br>
      <p><strong>Snakes</strong> - Snakes evolved from short-legged, long-bodied lizards. Some modern snakes actually have the remnants of their development, but most are limbless. All snakes have teeth, and jaws that extend a lot, which would make sense as they are all predators. Some snakes have evolved to include venom in their salivary glands. </p><br>
      <p><strong>Crocodiles</strong>– Crocodiles are predators that live in or near water. They have a strategy to pull prey down and tear prey apart, to eat into chunks. Interestingly, crocodiles have four-chambered hearts which help them circulate blood more effective, much like how birds and mammals do. Another interesting fact is that crocodiles are the closest-living relative to birds, and one can see this in their complex parental behaviors. </p><br>
      
      <img class="centermod" src="images/chordates/reptiles.png"><br>

      <h3>Impact and Importance</h3>
        <p>One interesting instance of reptiles being importance for humans is in regards to human health. There are many reptile substances that produce substances that helps scientists to create medications that would be helpful for certain conditions. Examples include snake venom being used to create high blood pressure medication and komodo dragon venom being used for its anti-coagulant properties. </p><br>

      <p>Birds are animals that have feathers, technically, modified reptilian scales. Dinosaurs are considered as relatives to birds, with multiple dinosaurs displaying general characteristics of birds. <em>Sinosauropteryx prima</em> had lived with small downy feathers, similar to chick’s downy feathers, which helped them keep insulated. <em>Archaeopteryx</em> was a dinosaur that was similar in birds, having short, downy feathers, as well as flight feathers.  </p><br>
      <img class="centermod" style="width: 400px;" src="images/chordates/sino.jpg"><br>
      <p>The earliest known bird with a beak is <em>Confuciusornis sactus</em>, with a beak that looks like that of modern birds, though you can still see their dinosaur ancestry through its grasping, clawed digits at the tips of its wings.  </p><br>
      <img class="centermod" style="width: 400px;" src="images/chordates/confu.jpg"><br>
      <p>Since birds are amniotes, they produce eggs with internal fertilization, with the eggs coated with a calcium shell. Birds also have beaks, jaw bones covered with layers of keratin. There are many different types of beaks suited to different diets. One common example to display this is the adaptive radiation of Galapagos birds, documented by Charles Darwin. </p><br>
      <p>Birds are endotherms, meaning they heat from within, which allows them to maintain their body temperature within a limited range.  </p><br>
      <p>Feathers are also one important part of birds, in which they have two types, downy and flight. Downy feathers slow down heat exchange and allows for them to maintain their body temperature more.  </p><br>
      <p>Flight feathers are concerned with flying and are one of the important adaptations that allows birds to fly, along with a light weight skeleton, powerful muscles, efficient organ systems, and wings. Wings are modified appendages, with feathers that go outward, to increase surface area. The way these flight feathers help wings is that it helps give the wing shape and helps the bird lift. </p><br>
      <p>Since flight requires a lot of energy, they need to have adequate oxygen respiration rates, and thus they have a specialized respiratory organs called air sacs, that helps them continually add air to their systems. </p><br>
      <p>Birds are diverse, including 9000 species of birds, that vary in size and composition. More than half of the bird species belong to a subgroup of perching birds. Most birds go through migration, where the birds’ biological clock, move in sync with an environmental rhythm. They use the sun, the stars and most importantly the earth’s magnetic field as directional cues. </p><br>
      
      <img class="centermod" src="images/chordates/birds.png">
      <h3>Impact and Importance</h3>
        <p>Birds are important polinators. They move pollen, the microspores or male sex cells of plants, to create new plants. Normally, these are birds that are small, like hummingbirds. Another interesting impact of birds is in agriculture. They eat pests and often help to fertilize the land through their organic matter.</p><br>

      <p>Mammals come from the Latin word, mamma, meaning breast, due to the ability of mammals to produce milk. Females nourish their offspring with this milk they secrete from their mammary glands. </p><br>
      <p>Mammals are the only animals that have hair or fur, which are both modifications of scales. This is because, like birds, they are endotherms. Fur or hair helps them maintain their body temperatures. Some mammals can also sweat in order to control their temperature.  </p><br>
      <p>There are three main groups in mammals: Monotremes, marsupials and placental mammals. </p><br>

      <h4>Mammal Groups</h4><br>

      <p><strong>Monotremes</strong> – There are only three extant species of monotremes, including two species of anteaters and the platypus. Female monotremes lay and incubate eggs that have a leathery shell, much like reptiles. Their milk comes from skin openings in their body, since they do not have nipples.</p><br>
      <p><strong>Marsupials</strong> – Most marsupials are concentrated on Australia and other nearby areas.  Their offspring develops briefly in their mother’s body, and are forced to move to their mother’s pouch to develop even further, by sucking on their mother’s milk.  </p><br>
      <p><strong>Placental Mammals</strong> - Placental mammals have the benefit of developing to a more advanced stage in their mother’s body, by using an organ called the placenta. The placenta is an organ that allows developmental materials to pass through maternal and embryotic zones safely. Most mammals are now placental. </p><br>

      <p>To see how why most mammals are placental, we can take a look at tectonic plates as a possible answer to the unpopularity of monotremes and marsupials in comparison. </p><br>
      <p>The first monotremes and marsupials evolved and migrated through parts of the supercontinent Pangaea, and became popular very quick, during the Jurassic period (150 MYA)</p><br>

      <img class="centermod" src="images/chordates/pangaea.jpg"><br>

      <p>During the Cretaceous period, southern land masses of Pangaea drifted away, leading to the isolated evolution of marsupials in those land masses. One glaring example of those land masses containing marsupials is Australia.  (130-85 MYA)</p><br>

      <p>As the years followed, mammals expanded in range and diversity, while South America was isolated with their own marsupials and early placental mammals. (65 MYA) </p><br>

      <p>But, a rejoining in the Pliocene period caused an invasion in South America, caused by developed and advanced placental mammals.  (5 MYA)</p><br>

      <p>If you think about it, all kangaroos and koalas might have not existed, if not for their isolation from the outside world. </p><br>
      
      <h3>Impact and Importance</h3>
        <p>Most mammals help the world by contributing to the food web, or by helping to spread seeds through their food. Some also become pollinators</p><br>

        <p>Some mammals also prove helpful to us humans, like dogs and cats, which become our pets, who have co-evolved with us through time.</p>
