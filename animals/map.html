      <p>The pin you clicked on is a picture of a lace coral, located in the Indian ocean, a part of the phylum Cnidaria, the second basal taxa after Porifera. </p><br>

      <p>Cnidaria's name comes from the Greek word, cnidos, which means "nettle", a kind of stinging plant. In fact, Cnidaria is characterized by their stinging tentacles, with various important organelles that help them capture prey, called <strong>nematocysts.</strong> Examples of organisms in this phylum are corals and jellyfish.
      </p><br>

      <img class="centermod" src="../assets/images2/hydracnido.png"><br>

      <p>Other than that, Cnidaria is also characterized for its radially similar bodies, categorized into two distinct shapes called <strong>medusa and polyp</strong>. In both, a tentacle-ringed mouth serves as the facilitator for digestion and gas exchange. </p><br>

      <img class="centermod" src="../assets/images2/polypmedusa.png"><br>

      <p>In conception, they only form two germ layers, the ectoderm and the mesoderm, which give rise to the epidermis and the gastrodermis. In the epidermis, there are structures called <strong>rhopalia</strong> that can generate signals in response to stimuli. In order to connect those sensory stimuli, a simple nervous system or <strong>nerve net</strong> is in place, though this can be used to move contractile cells.  Such contractions redistribute the phylum's water-filled insides and create a <strong>hydrostatic skeleton</strong>, their own support system.</p>

      <p>The pin you clicked on is an example of a recently discovered new species that appeared in metropolitan France, <em>Humbertium covidum</em>, an organism in the phylum Plathyhelminthes.  </p><br>

      <p>The phylum name comes from Greek: platy-means flat, and helminth means worm. This phylum is characterized by the flattened form of the worm, but also evolution-wise, the emergence of three-layered embryo and organ systems. 
      </p><br>

      <p>Flatworms are bilateral and cephalized. They have genes that resemble coeloms, despite not having a coelom at all.</p><br>

      <img class="centermod" src="../assets/images2/planarian.png"><br>

      <p>Turbellarians, flukes, and tapeworms are the three main groups. Most tubellarians live in the sea, but some live in fresh water, and a few live in moist places on land. They are often found as parasites on animals, such as flukes and tapeworms.</p><br>

      <p>Turbellians have a mouth and a gut, however tapeworms do not have either of these, due to their parasitic nature; as they had a habitat rich in resources and predigested food, those traits were ruled out in the long run.</p><br>

      <h3>Impact and Importance</h3>

      <p>The flatworm you saw in the picture was only discovered recently, but it is already being studied for the possibility of it ruining biodiversity in Europe, as it may be an invasive species in the future.</p><br>

      <p>Parasites also pose a very huge problem health wise. If humans ingest parasitic eggs and tapeworms grow in their bodies, it would be dangerous and even lethal. In under-developed countries, where medication is not readily available, this would be disastrous.</p><br>

      <p>This organism is a nematode, or simply a roundworm. This</p><br>

      <p>
        Nematodes are bilateral, unsegmented worms with a cuticle-covered sylindrical body. It is also characterized by a muscular pharynx which sucks up food and with the digestive system being complete, making up the pseudocoelom. 
      </p><br>

      <p>

        Roundworms have collagen-rich, pliable cuticles that is repeatedly molted as the animal grows. </p><br>

      <img class="centermod" src="../assets/images2/nematodee.png"><br>

      
        <h3>Impact and Importance</h3>

        <p>Some roundworms are parasitic, and impair human health. Eating undercooked pork can lead to an infection by <em>Trichinella spiralis</em>, which if not treated properly, could be fatal. It moves from the digestive system, through the blood and in the muscles where it forms cysts.</p><br>

        <p>A creepy fact: some parasites are just dormant in the body. People with <em>Ascaris lumbricoides</em> for example often show no symptoms. It is unknown how many people world wide are infected by the Ascaris group, but currently, 1 billion people, primarily in Asia and Latin America, have it.</p>

      <p>Arthropods are bilateral organisms that have a reduced coelom. They have a hard exoskeleton with complete organ systems. Modern subgroups of arthropods include crustaceans and insects, which include a lot of organisms. If you were to measure evolutionary success by how many species form in one clade, then arthropods would be the most successful.</p><br>
      <p> There are overall 5 key adaptations that let to their evolutionary success. </p><br>
      <h4>Key Arthropod Adaptations</h4><br>
      <p><strong>Hardened Exoskeleton</strong> – Arthropods have a skin made of chitin, proteins and waxes. This is called an exoskeleton, and has many functions, including helping to fend predators and helping to support their weight. Though exoskeletons may be hard, they molt and thus facilitate growth in arthropods. </p><br>
      <p><strong>Jointed Appendages</strong> – Exoskeletons are hard, and if they were rigid, all arthropods wouldn’t be able to move correctly. Thus, arthropods evolved to include only thin exoskeleton-like parts on the joints so they could be able to move. Arthropods themselves means “jointed leg”, and these jointed legs are then modified for specialized tasks. </p><br>
      <p><strong>Highly Modified Segments</strong> – Early forms of the clade had distinct body segments and similar body appendages, which were not specialized and modified for special use. Now, most modern arthropods fused their parts into different structural units, such as the thorax and the abdomen. Another feature is that their segments were also modified for special use, such as in insects, where thin extensions of the wall of some segments became their wings. </p><br>
      <p><strong>Specializations</strong>  – Arthropods have sensory organs that are built well, such as one or more pairs of eyes, and antennae that can detect touch and certain chemicals. </p><br>
      <p><strong>Specialized Developmental Stages</strong> – As children turn into adults, a process called metamorphosis where the organism is remodeled, happens. Each stage of metamorphosis is built for a different task, and this also helps them prevent competition with each other for the same niche. </p><br>
