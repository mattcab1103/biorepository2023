      <p>
         In Grade 10 biology, you would have learned about genes and all other things related to them like DNA and RNA. However, did you know that these simple molecules can show the story of the evolution of life on earth?<br><br>
         
         To learn how, let's start with genomics. Genomics is the study of genomes or rather sets of genes and their interactions. Biologists who specialize in genomics study lots of things, but we would focus in on the evolution component. <br><br>

         They study genomic evolution, in which each species diverges from its common ancestor, more and more mutations happen over time.

         Biodiversity consists of the multitudes of variation in the area, consisting of 3 parts: <strong>variation in species, within species,  and the ecosystem.</strong>
        </p>
        <h4> Variation in species </h4>
        <p>
          Variation in species talks about the genetics of a certain population in a species. It bases these on alleles, one of two or more copies of a gene in the population, which gives rise to different mutations.
        </p>
        <h4> Variation within species </h4>
        <p>
          Variation within species talks about the total diversity of the ecosystem, taking into account the many species that inhabit it.
        </p>
        <h4> Variation within the ecosystem </h4>
        <p>
          Variation within the ecosystem takes into account the two variations and totals them. Genetic mutations(variations in species) and vast number of species(variation within species) effectively change and alter the environment. One example of this, is within coral reefs in oceans. All the components of the coral reefs serve as a help to maintaining the ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p><strong>These three variations comprise and define what biodiversity means.</strong></p>
        <h4>Then, why is biodiversity so important?</h4>
        <p> Biodiversity sets the stage for the stabilization of the world. So many things rely on biodiversity to keep running, including human society. Human society has been relying on biodiversity since the beginning, producing jobs and giving resources like meat, shelter, etc. By protecting biodiversity, we can protect our kind.</p>
        <p>There have also been various studies on the effect of biodiversity on our environment. Climate change, erosion control, and even the relevance of it regarding zoonotic diseases like CoVID-19.</p>
        <h2><a>Protecting biodiversity is a means of protecting the world.</a></h2>
