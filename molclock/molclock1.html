      <p>
         In Grade 10 biology, you would have learned about genes and all other things related to them like DNA and RNA. However, did you know that these simple molecules can show the story of the evolution of life on earth?<br><br>
         
         To learn how, let's start with genomics. Genomics is the study of genomes or rather sets of genes and their interactions. Biologists who specialize in genomics study lots of things, but we would focus in on the evolution component. <br><br>

         They study genomic evolution, in which each species diverges from its common ancestor, more and more mutations happen over time. 
       </p>

       <h3 id="2.1">Sets of genes determine the evolutionary history of life (2.1)</h3>
        <p> As more and more mutations occur, as you trace it back to its common ancestor, you could see the sequence of mutations that happened that caused the species to be the way it is now. </p>

        <p>For easier conceptualization, recall the past phylogenetic trees. This time though, we should consider the divergence based on molecular data. Ignore the character traits on the trees and pretend those are divergence points.</p>

        <p>For each divergence, more and more evolution occurs which causes the genome to have a special identity which in turn creates the organisms we know today. In some way, they are connected by these simple genomes, and show their evolutionary relationships. This means all organisms are one way or another connected.</p>

        <p>Let's see a phylogenetic tree that is really based on genetics.</p>

        <p>This phylogenetic tree shows the relationships between domestic dog breeds. Here, you can see traces of how certain breeds have been used to create other ones. For example, pugs have been used to make dogs smaller during the 1500s.</p>


        <p>In the next page, we would discover how these changes can make a clock. A molecular clock in particular!</p>
