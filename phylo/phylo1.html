         Before reading this lesson, imagine that you were outside your hour in the province. Take note of some of the things you would say are organisms and count how many.
         <em>Maybe you would imagine fields filled with grass. Some trees swaying in the wind, with animals like goats near you or birds flying above you. Maybe some insects on the ground, ants, termites. Maybe even microorganisms in the soil. And if you tried to count them using your hands, you would lose count of all the organisms surrounding you.</em>
         <strong>All these things contribute to the whole biodiversity of the area. </strong>

       <h3 id="1.1">Biodiversity is the variation of an ecosystem. (1.1)</h3>
       <p>
         Biodiversity consists of the multitudes of variation in the area, consisting of 3 parts: <strong>variation in species, within species,  and the ecosystem.</strong>
        </p>
        <h4> Variation in species </h4>
        <p>
          Variation in species talks about the genetics of a certain population in a species. It bases these on alleles, one of two or more copies of a gene in the population, which gives rise to different mutations.
        </p>
        <h4> Variation within species </h4>
        <p>
          Variation within species talks about the total diversity of the ecosystem, taking into account the many species that inhabit it.
        </p>
        <h4> Variation within the ecosystem </h4>
        <p>
          Variation within the ecosystem takes into account the two variations and totals them.
        </p>
        <p><strong>These three variations comprise and define what biodiversity means.</strong></p>
        <h4>Then, why is biodiversity so important?</h4>
        <p> Biodiversity sets the stage for the stabilization of the world. So many things rely on biodiversity to keep running, including human society. Human society has been relying on biodiversity since the beginning, producing jobs and giving resources like meat, shelter, etc. By protecting biodiversity, we can protect our kind.</p>
        <p>There have also been various studies on the effect of biodiversity on our environment. Climate change, erosion control, and even the relevance of it regarding zoonotic diseases like CoVID-19.</p>
        <h2><a>Protecting biodiversity is a means of protecting the world.</a></h2>
